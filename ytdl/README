YTDL is a queued youtube audio download system. It uses zenity as the UI and
will download the audio of chosen youtube videos as an mp3.

There are three scripts that make up the system. The first is ``ytdl-queue``
which calls zenity to gather info from the user and set up the queue file for a
download job. Next is the ``ytdl-download-next`` script which downloads the
oldest queued job in the queue directory. Finally comes the ``ytdl-download``
script which calls ``ytdl-download-next`` over and over until the queue has
emptied.

To save typing the youtube URL that you give should only be the video ID
portion, "tuPDBFpVpl8" instead of
"https://www.youtube.come/watch?v=tuPDBFpVpl8".

To complete the automation of the system you can set up a cronjob or sytemd
service/timer pair to call the ``ytdl-download`` script periodically to
periodically clear the download queue. You may also wish to write a similar
cronjob or systemd service/timer pair to do something fancy with the
downloaded files.
